      "message": "Can a \"kicked\" member join the (same) group again? If yes - it should stay \"kicked\" - if no I guess \"block\" is the correct string.\n\nHowever if a kicked / blocked member can still contact the admin using the 1:1 chat / audio /video call there should be \n1) a notification that the blocked member can still reach others / you using the 1:1 chat and/or 1:1 audio video call option or if you have multiple groups can the kicked / blocked user still join another group / or will automatically be removed from the group too?\n2) maybe the strings should be changed to \"block user in this group\" and/ or a dialog that shows \"This member will be justed blocked in this group. Communication like 1:1 or other groups (?) is still possible\"- if this is true",
