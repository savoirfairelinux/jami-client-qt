      "message": "The patch doesn\u0027t remove any information, the build date is still there like before.\n\nI do think it would make sense to include the latest git tag and Andreas and I actually had a discussion about this, but right now the tag generated by Jenkins for a release is based on its commit date, which can be confusing to users because that doesn\u0027t necessarily match the date of the release itself. So I think we should fix that first.",
