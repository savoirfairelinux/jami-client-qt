When sharing a screen, the first frame seesm to be black, so if nothing moves, the video stays black (until a window is moved, or a keyframe sent)\n+ 3. It\u0027s more a behaviour thing: When stopping the screen sharing, it should go in the state from before the screen sharing imho (like if no camera, if the user starts a screen share, and then stop, it should not start the camera)",
