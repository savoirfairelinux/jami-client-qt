      "message": "Should adding an already added Jami participant be allowed, as 1 contact may be linked on multiple devices, allowing for multiple instances of the same contact, yet different devices (and hence participants)?\n\nUse case: Husband and wife have the same JamiID as they share the same contact list. There is a family group call where the children and the parents (the husband and wife) join the call.",

If I want to call a same account on 2 different devices, then I must create a swarm with this account and launch a call in this swarm. Then every device which has access to this conversation can join using the \"join call\" message in the swarm",
