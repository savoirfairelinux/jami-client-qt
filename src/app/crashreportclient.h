/**
 * In the context of Jami where we employ GnuTLS, OpenSSL, and other cryptographic
 * components as part of secure communication protocols, it is essential to configure
 * crash reports with security in mind to prevent sensitive data from being exposed in crash
 * reports. We must assume that attackers may attempt to exploit vulnerabilities based on
 * stack data including values of cryptographic keys, certificates, etc. that may be used
 * in some way to compromise the security of the user's account.
 *
 * We attempt to mitigate this risk by configuring crash reports to avoid collecting stack
 * data beyond the offending function that caused the crash. We make the assumption that
 * cryptographically sensitive data is not stored on the stack by 3rd party libraries.
 *
 * We also take care to avoid sending crash reports automatically and instead require user
 * consent before uploading the last report.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: The opt-in approach is crucial, and the potential implications of transmitting
 * these reports must be communicated to the user. The user should be informed that we cannot
 * guarantee the security of the data in the crash report, even if we take steps to avoid
 * leaking any sensitive information.
 *
 * We offer the following configuration options to enhance security:
 *
 * - (Option) EnableCrashReporting (default - true):
 *   An application settings allowing users to disable crash handling entirely.
 *
 * - (Option) EnableAutomaticCrashReporting (default - false):
 *   This setting allows users to opt-in to automatic crash reporting, which should be disabled
 *   by default. When the application crashes, the user should be prompted to upload the last
 *   crash report. If the user agrees, the report will be uploaded to the server. If this
 *   setting is enabled, no prompt will be shown, and the report will be uploaded automatically
 *   when the application crashes.
 *
 * Further considerations:
 *
 * - **Annotations**:
 *   Allows the inclusion of custom metadata in crash reports, such as the application version
 *   and build number, without exposing sensitive information. We must include this information
 *   to use the crash reports constructively.
