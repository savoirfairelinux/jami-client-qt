>>> how can I add a git repo (https://github.com/zxing-cpp/zxing-cpp.git) to a cmakelists.
... txt for building a cpp project?
You're on the right track! Here's how to integrate the zxing-cpp library into your 
CMake project:

```cmake
# ... (Your existing CMakeLists.txt content)

# Find Git
find_package(Git REQUIRED)

# Define ZxingCpp directory
set(ZXINGCPP_DIR "${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/zxingcpp")

# Download and build zxing-cpp (if not already present)
if (NOT EXISTS "${ZXINGCPP_DIR}")
    message(STATUS "Downloading and building zxing-cpp...")
    execute_process(COMMAND git clone https://github.com/zxing-cpp/zxing-cpp.git 
${ZXINGCPP_DIR})

    # Build zxing-cpp as a subproject (adjust as needed)
    add_subdirectory(${ZXINGCPP_DIR})
endif()

# Link against the ZxingCpp library
target_link_libraries(YOUR_TARGET_NAME zxingcpp)
```

**Explanation:**


1. **Find Git:** The `find_package(Git REQUIRED)` line ensures that CMake can use 
Git for downloading the repository.

2. **Define Directory:** We set a variable (`ZXINGCPP_DIR`) to store the path where 
we'll download and build zxing-cpp.

3. **Conditional Download/Build:**
   * `if (NOT EXISTS "${ZXINGCPP_DIR}")`: This checks if zxing-cpp already exists in 
the specified directory. If not, it proceeds with downloading and building.
   * `execute_process(COMMAND git clone ...)`: Uses Git to clone the repository into 
the designated directory.

4. **Subdirectory Build:**

   * `add_subdirectory(${ZXINGCPP_DIR})`: Instructs CMake to treat zxing-cpp as a 
subproject and build it within your main project's structure.

5. **Linking Libraries:**
   * `target_link_libraries(YOUR_TARGET_NAME zxingcpp)`: Links the built ZxingCpp 
library (`zxingcpp`) to your target (replace `YOUR_TARGET_NAME` with the name of 
your executable or library).

**Important Notes:**


* **Adjust Subproject Build:** You might need to adjust the 
`add_subdirectory(${ZXINGCPP_DIR})` line based on zxing-cpp's build system. Check 
their documentation for specific instructions if necessary.
* **Build System Compatibility:** Make sure your CMake version is compatible with 
the build system used by zxing-cpp.

**Additional Tips:**



* Consider using a package manager like Conan or vcpkg to manage external 
dependencies more easily in the future.
