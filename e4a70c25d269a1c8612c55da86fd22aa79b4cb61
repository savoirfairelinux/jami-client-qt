      "message": "When hovering above the `Join in audio` and `Join in video` buttons and the icons at the top right of the chat window, both have the same popup tooltip, i.e. `Join call`. Should the popup tooltip be different? Perhaps screen readers could also benefit from the different popup tooltips.\n\nSuggestions:\n1. In `Started a call` in chat, change `Join in audio` to `Join call in audio`\n2. In `Started a call` in chat, change `Join in video` to `Join call in video`\n3. (a) Telephone icon in top right of chat, change popup tooltip `Join call` to `Join call in audio`\u003cbr\u003e\n(b) In `Started a call` in chat, change popup tooltip `Join call` to `Join call in audio`\n4. (a) Video icon in top right of chat, change popup tooltip `Join call` to `Join call in video`\u003cbr\u003e\n(b) In `Started a call` in chat, change popup tooltip `Join call` to `Join call in video`\n5. In chat, change `Started a call` to `Call in progress`\n\nhttps://git.jami.net/savoirfairelinux/jami-client-qt/-/issues/1616\n\nThank you",
