;;; A full-blown development environment that can be used to build the
;;; whole project.  The sensitive (i.e., patched) dependencies are
;;; consciously omitted from this list so that the bundled libraries
;;; are the ones used, which is usually what is desired for
;;; development purposes.

;;; The build.py script makes use of it to build Jami in a Linux
;;; container with the dependencies below when Guix is detected (and
;;; no /etc/os-release file exists) or when explicitly specified,
;;; e.g.:
;;;
;;; $ ./build.py --distribution=guix --install
;;;
;;; It can also be invoked directly to spawn a development environment, like so:
;;;
;;; $ guix shell --pure --manifest=guix/manifest.scm
