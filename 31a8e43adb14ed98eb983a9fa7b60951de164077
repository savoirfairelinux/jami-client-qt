      "message": "Thanks :) just some minor things below.  I\u0027ll try to test this out today or tomorrow and give an actual code review as well.\n\nBTW, can we please keep using dashes in filename(s)?  I personally prefer them over underscores, and IIRC we standardized on them recently as well:\nhttps://git.jami.net/savoirfairelinux/jami-client-qt/-/tree/master/extras/scripts\nSo, how about gen-resources-qrc.py?",

      "message": "Right so, consistency-is-king should generally be applied, and yeah we did just recently discuss and agree on dashes, and yeah I would normally vote we adhere to PEP 8 style guide here and migrate JUST the other python scripts to have the same style(or remove separators completely) for a couple of reasons:\n1. no questioning, just use a linter, effectively removing this current dispute\n2. doesn\u0027t import without some special syntax\n3. double click select the file name not just a part\n\nHowever, these are scripts and not used as modules. If and when the day comes that a module is introduced, I would suggest using underscores.",
