      "message": "Nice, thanks for putting this together :)\n\nI tested the patch, and it would be great if the following would also get resized:\n\n1. in the chatview, the call statuses (e.g. \u0027Outgoing call\u0027 or \u0027Missed outgoing call\u0027, etc.) and their timestamps, and the initial \u0027Swarm created\u0027 bold text in the very beginning of a swarm conversation;\n2. in Account Settings, the device IDs of Linked Devices;\n3. under Media Settings, the name and sample rate for each audio or video codec; and\n4. in the about dialog, the name of the contributors.\n\nAdditionally, depending on the time/effort required, it would be great if other dimensions are changed also, to give a more complete \u0027zooming\u0027 experience.  This could be in a separate patch.  Things like:\n\n- font size and width/height of buttons and other elements/components;\n- padding/margins between components, and the line-heights between texts;\n- icon and avatar sizes; and so on.",
