    <p><b>Jami</b>, a GNU package, is software for universal and distributed peer-to-peer communication that respects the freedom and privacy of its users.</p>
    <p>Jami is the simplest and easiest way to connect with people (and devices) with instant messaging, audio, and video calls over the <b>Internet</b> and LAN/WAN <b>intranets</b>.</p>
    <p>Jami is a free/libre, end-to-end encrypted, and private <b>communication platform</b>.</p>
    <p>Jami is <b>open-source</b> software that <b>prioritizes user privacy</b>.</p>
    <p>Jami has a professional-looking design and is available for a wide range of platforms. Unlike the alternatives, Jami <b>calls are directly between users</b>, as it does not use servers to handle calls.</p>
    <p>This gives the greatest privacy, as the <b>distributed</b> nature of Jami means your calls are only between participants.</p>
    <p>One-to-one and <b>group conversations</b> with Jami are enhanced with instant messaging, audio and video calling, recording and sending audio and video messages, file transfers, screen sharing, and location sharing.</p>
    <p>Jami can also function as a <b>SIP client</b>.</p>
    <p>Multiple <b>Jami extensions</b> are available: Audio Filter, Auto Answer, Green Screen, Segmentation, Watermark, and Whisper Transcript.</p>
    <p>Jami can be easily deployed in organizations with the <b>JAMS (Jami Account Management Server)</b>, allowing users to connect with their corporate credentials or create local accounts. JAMS allows you to <b>manage your own</b> Jami community while taking advantage of Jami’s distributed network architecture.</p>
    <p>Jami is <b>available for</b> GNU/Linux, Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, Android TV, and web browsers, making Jami an interoperable and cross-platform communication framework.</p>
    <p><b>Manage multiple</b> SIP accounts, Jami accounts, and JAMS accounts with the Jami client installed on one or multiple devices.</p>
    <p>Jami is free, unlimited, private, advertising‑free, compatible, fast, autonomous, and anonymous.</p>

    <p xml:lang="hu">A Jami – amelyet korábban Ring néven ismertek – egy nyílt forráskódú alternatíva is (a Facebook Messenger, a Signal, a Skype, a Teams, a Telegram, a TikTok, a Viber, a WhatsApp, a Zoom számára), amely előtérbe helyezi a felhasználók magánéletét.</p>
    <p>Jami has a professional-looking design and is available for a wide range of platforms. Unlike the alternatives, calls using Jami are directly between users as it does not use servers to handle calls.</p>
    <p xml:lang="hu">A Jami professzionális megjelenésű, és platformok széles skálájához elérhető. Az alternatívákkal ellentétben a Jami-t használó hívások közvetlenül a felhasználók között zajlanak, mivel nem használ kiszolgálókat a hívások kezelésére.</p>
    <p>This gives the greatest privacy as the distributed nature of Jami means your calls are only between participants.</p>
    <p xml:lang="hu">Ez biztosítja a legnagyobb magánéletet, mivel a Jami elosztott jellege azt jelenti, hogy a hívások csak a résztvevők között zajlanak.</p>
    <p>One-to-one and group conversations with Jami are enhanced with: instant messaging; audio and video calling; recording and sending audio and video messages; file transfers; screen sharing; and, location sharing.</p>
    <p xml:lang="hu">A Jamival folytatott személyes és csoportos beszélgetéseket a következők javítják: azonnali üzenetküldés; hang- és videohívások; hang- és videoüzenetek rögzítése és küldése; fájlátvitel; képernyőmegosztás; és helymegosztás.</p>
    <p>Jami can also function as a SIP client.</p>
    <p xml:lang="hu">A Jami SIP-ügyfélként is működhet.</p>
    <p>Jami has multiple extensions available: Audio Filter; Auto Answer; Green Screen; Watermark; and, Whisper Transcript.</p>
    <p xml:lang="hu">A Jami-nek több bővítménye is elérhető: hangszűrő; automatikus válasz; zöld képernyő; vízjel; és, suttogó átirat.</p>
    <p>Jami can be easily deployed in organizations with the “Jami Account Management Server” (JAMS), allowing users to connect with their corporate credentials or create local accounts. JAMS allows you to manage your own Jami community while taking advantage of Jami’s distributed network architecture.</p>
    <p xml:lang="hu">A Jami könnyen telepíthető a szervezetekben a JAMS (Jami Account Management Server – Jami fiókkezelő kiszolgáló), amely lehetővé teszi a felhasználók számára, hogy csatlakozzanak vállalati hitelesítő adataikhoz, vagy helyi fiókokat hozzanak létre. A JAMS lehetővé teszi saját Jami közösségének kezelését, miközben kihasználja a Jami elosztott hálózati architektúráját.</p>
    <p>Jami is available for GNU/Linux, Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, and Android TV, making Jami an interoperable and cross-platform communication framework.</p>
    <p xml:lang="hu">A Jami elérhető GNU/Linux, Windows, macOS, iOS, Android és Android TV rendszereken, így a Jami egy interoperábilis és platformok közötti kommunikációs keretrendszer.</p>
