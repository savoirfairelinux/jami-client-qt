      "message": "Nice, thanks again.\n\nOne other thing that just came to mind: it would be neat to have a\npreference option for this under the General settings view.\nAnd/or perhaps a proper font picker dialog to also let the user\nchoose between the default system font and any other font available\non their machine, per #512.  These could be separate patches though,\nI guess, so otherwise LGTM.",

      "message": "what kind of general preference do you think? Like Default \"zoom: 110%\"?\nActually it just adds an offset to the font until a maximum (cf JamiTheme), so not sure zoom is the word for this.",

      "message": "Yeah \u0027zoom\u0027 would probably be misleading indeed, since this is\ntechnically not zooming.\n\nMaybe something like this:\n\nFont size offset:\n\u003c--- (-30) -- ... -- (-1) -- (0) -- (1) -- (2) -- ... -- (30) ---\u003e\n\nOr with a better interface (maybe a dropdown?).  Just something that\nthe user could visually discover and change from the settings view.\n\nOr, if you think it might not be worth it and we may later redo this\nas a proper/complete zoom feature + separate font picker dialog then\nwe could skip it for now.",
