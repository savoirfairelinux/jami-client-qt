      "message": "Nice, thanks again.\n\nOne other thing that just came to mind: it would be neat to have a\npreference option for this under the General settings view.\nAnd/or perhaps a proper font picker dialog to also let the user\nchoose between the default system font and any other font available\non their machine, per #512.  These could be separate patches though,\nI guess, so otherwise LGTM.",
