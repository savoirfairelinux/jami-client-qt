Not sure what the SFL convention is with acronyms, which is this context.\n\nIf uppercase should be used with acronyms too, should variable name be `enablePTT`?\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push-to-talk\n\nThinking further about this feature, should `press-to-talk` be changed to `press-to-transmit` as this is a superset of `talk`. Jami users may be transmitting music during music lessons, which is not talking.\n\nThank you",
