      "message": "It is understood that:\n\n1. There is no limited as to how many times you can be blocked and unblocked.\n\n1. `Block contact` blocks that contact from communicating with you on Jami.\n\n1. `Block member` blocks that contact from communicating in **one** particular group conversation. The are still able to be in a 1:1 conversation with you and other group conversations which they are not blocked; however, they are blocked from one particular group conversation.\n\n1. If you get kicked (i.e. blocked), you are **unable** to rejoin (i.e. unblocked) as many times as you like. The person who kicked (i.e. blocked) you needs to reinstate (i.e. unblock) you.\n\nUnable to write the behavior when a contact is in a group conversation and are not a `Block member` and are a `Block contact` with you. Perhaps the developers can provide the logic on this one?\n\nUsing `block` and `unblock` can help:\n\n1. Unify the terminology throughout Jami.\n\n1. Help translators in making better translations, and hopefully not have culturally inappropriate translations. It is possible that `kick` could be translated poorly leaving a bad taste in peopleâ€™s mouths.",
