      "message": "I\u0027ve seen similar errors in the past. I don\u0027t know exactly in what conditions they occur but I think it\u0027s more likely to happen if you haven\u0027t built Jami in a while and some of the contribs have been updated in the meantime; it seems that the build script sometimes fails to detect everything that should be rebuilt (or maybe doesn\u0027t rebuild them in the right order, I\u0027m not sure). Sometimes I get a linker error instead of an unknown type name error; in either case doing a clean build generally solves the issue.\n\nI\u0027m guessing you did the `git clean -xfd` in the `jami-client-qt` folder, which doesn\u0027t help because `git clean` doesn\u0027t apply recursively to git submodules. You need to do `git clean -xfd` from the `daemon` subfolder if you want to clean the contribs (all `./build.py --clean` does is call `git clean -xfd` in the main repo + all the submodules).",
