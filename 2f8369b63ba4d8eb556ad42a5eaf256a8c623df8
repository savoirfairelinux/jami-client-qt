      "message": "Currently this dialog is made to appear only when a user presses the \"add\" button or sends a message to a user who isn\u0027t in their contacts already. As I see it the block functionality shouldn\u0027t appear in this dialog as it isn\u0027t related to adding someone. Moreover its a functionality which is used less frequently then adding a contact so I think that for the time being it should be dealt with in a separate manner.",
