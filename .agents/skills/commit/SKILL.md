# Grouping
Check `git diff` and `git diff --staged` before writing a message. One commit per logical unit of work — do not mix unrelated changes. Unstage unrelated files and commit them separately.

# Message format
`type(scope): subject` — conventional commits
Types: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`

- Subject ≤50 chars
- Body lines ≤72 chars, blank line between subject and body; keep the body concise and to the point

```

```
